| **P-1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES, RULES, AND CONVENTIONS** | | |
| P-10 Introduction | A structure containing at least one carbon atom is an organic compound, named using principles like substitutive or replacement nomenclature. | |
| P-12.1 Preferred IUPAC Names (PINs) | PINs are single names generated by applying strict rules, intended for official and legal documents to ensure unambiguous identification. | |
| P-12.2 Preselected Names | Names chosen when PIN methodology is too cumbersome or when traditional names (like certain hydrides) are preferred for clarity. | |
| P-12.3 Retained Names | Traditional names (e.g., aniline, phenol, methane) maintained for general nomenclature, sometimes with defined limits on allowed substitution. | |
| P-13 Operations in Nomenclature of Organic Compounds | Nomenclature uses operations like substitutive, replacement, additive, subtractive, conjunctive, multiplicative, and fusion to construct names. | |
| P-13.3 The Additive Operation | Formally describes the assembly of components without atom loss, expressed using prefixes, suffixes (like 'ium' or 'uide'), or a separate word (e.g., in adducts). | |
| P-13.4 The Subtractive Operation | Indicates the loss of a group or elements (like H atoms or $\text{H}_2\text{O}$), denoted by prefixes such as 'dehydro' or 'nor'. | |
| P-13.5 The Conjunctive Operation | Achieved by placing multiplicative prefixes ('bi', 'ter') or by juxtaposing component names (conjunctive nomenclature), or via ring formation. | |
| P-13.6 The Multiplicative Operation | Used to name assemblies of identical parent structures connected by a symmetrical multivalent group. | |
| P-13.8 Operations Used Only in the Nomenclature of Natural Products | Specialized operations using non-detachable prefixes like ‘de’, ‘des’, ‘anhydro’, and ‘abeo’ to denote structural modifications (skeletal contraction, expansion, or rearrangement). | |
| P-14.1 Bonding Number | Uses the $\lambda$-convention ($\lambda^n$) to indicate nonstandard valence states ($n$) or hypervalent atoms, which is fundamental since most names rely on standard valence states. | |
| P-14.2 Multiplicative Prefixes | Three types of prefixes are used to denote multiplicity: basic, complex/compound, and those for assemblies of identical units. | |
| P-14.2.1 Basic multiplicative prefixes | Simple prefixes (‘di’, ‘tri’, ‘tetra’, etc.) are generally the first choice to denote multiplicity of simple features or affixes. | |
| P-14.2.2 Numerical terms for compound or complex features | Prefixes ('bis', 'tris', 'tetrakis', etc.) are used for complex entities, substituted substituents, or when ambiguity would arise from using basic prefixes. | |
| P-14.3 Locants | Locants (numerals/letters) specify position and are placed immediately before the part of the name they relate to, except in contracted names. | |
| P-14.3.4 Omission of locants | Locants are omitted only if unnecessary in the unmodified name, but must be cited if required to indicate isotopic modification. | |
| P-14.3.5 Lowest set of locants | Sets of locants are compared term by term in increasing value, selecting the set with the lowest term at the first point of difference (e.g., 2,3,5 is lower than 2,4,5). | |
| P-14.4 Numbering | A hierarchy determines the numbering sequence to assign lowest locants: fixed numbering > heteroatoms/indicated H > suffixes (principal groups) > unsaturation > detachable prefixes. | |
| P-14.5 Alphanumerical Order | Detachable prefixes are cited alphabetically by Roman letters (ignoring multiplying prefixes); if prefixes are identical, priority goes to the group with the lowest locant set cited first. | |
| P-15.1.7.1.5 | If different substituent groups are present, they are cited in alphanumerical order; when groups occupy equivalent positions, the one cited first receives the lower locant. | |
| P-15.1.8.3 Type 3 Substitution of any kind is not allowed | Applies to retained functional class names (like certain simple esters or acid halides) where no substitution is permitted, although functionalization (e.g., salt formation) is allowed. | |
| P-15.3 Multiplicative Nomenclature | A subset of substitutive nomenclature, preferred when symmetrical conditions are met (P-51.3.1); it is expanded now to allow substitution on the central unit and the use of nonsymmetrical central units. | |
| P-15.4.1 General rules | Non-detachable 'a' prefixes designate replacing skeletal atoms; the system generates new acyclic parent hydrides whose numbering is fixed. | |
| P-15.5.3 Scope of functional replacement nomenclature | Prefixes and infixes are used to describe replacement in heterocyclic parent hydrides, characteristic groups (suffixes and prefixes), and functional parent compounds. | |
| P-15.6.1.3 | In conjunctive nomenclature, the side chain is considered to extend only from the principal group to the cyclic component; other chain members are named as substituents. | |
| P-15.6.1.4 | When a cyclic component carries at least two identical side chains, multiplicative prefixes ('di', 'tri') are used, and side chain locants use superscript Arabic numbers. | |
| P-16 Name Writing | Names are written according to specific symbolism to establish an unequivocal relationship between a name and its structure, prioritizing clarity and consistency. | |
| P-16.2 Punctuation | Uses commas, full stops, colons, semicolons, hyphens, and spaces in specific ways to avoid ambiguity in name construction. | |
| P-16.2.1 Commas | Used to separate locants, numerals, or italicized letters; also separates attached components, except for italicized letters denoting peri-fused junctions. | |
| P-16.2.4 Hyphens | Used to separate locants from words (e.g., 2-chloro-), italic letters from Roman letters, and stereodescriptors from the rest of the name. | |
| P-16.5 Enclosing Marks | Parentheses, brackets, and braces are used in the strict nesting order $\{[(\,\,)]\}$ to enclose parts dealing with specific structural features; they must not be omitted from PINs. | |
| P-16.9 Primes | Primes ($'$), double primes ($''$), etc., are added to locants/symbols without a space to differentiate identical locants, especially for N atoms (P-16.9.1) or in multiplicative/spiro systems (P-16.9.4). | |
| **P-2 PARENT HYDRIDES** | | |
| P-21 Mononuclear and Acyclic Polynuclear Parent Hydrides | Deals with naming parent hydrides with a single atom or unbranched/branched chains; uses replacement nomenclature ('a' prefixes) for heteroatoms. | |
| P-23 Polyalicyclic Parent Hydrides (Extended von Baeyer System) | Applies to saturated polyalicyclic ring systems, superseding earlier rules; uses prefixes like 'bicyclo', 'tricyclo', etc., and defines bridges. | |
| P-23.2.2 Naming bicyclic alicyclic hydrocarbons | Uses prefix ‘bicyclo’ followed by the alkane name of the same total number of atoms; bridge atom counts are cited in descending numerical order, separated by full stops, in brackets. | |
| P-24 Spiro Ring Systems | Defines nomenclature for compounds where two rings share a single atom (spiro atom); supersedes rules A-41, A-43, B-10, and B-12. | |
| P-24.3 Monospiro Ring Systems Containing Two Identical Polycyclic Ring Components | Uses prefix ‘spirobi’ before the component name in brackets; locants for the spiro atom (unprimed first) precede the name. | |
| P-24.8 Spiro Ring Systems Containing Atoms with Nonstandard Bonding Numbers | The $\lambda$-convention ($\lambda^n$) is placed at the front of the complete name or before the skeletal replacement prefix for the atom it refers to. | |
| P-25 FUSED AND BRIDGED FUSED RING SYSTEMS | Deals with ortho-fused and ortho- and peri-fused ring systems; fusion nomenclature for PINs requires at least two rings of five or more members. | |
| P-25.3.3 Numbering of fused ring systems | Fixed numbering is based on structure orientation (max rings in horizontal row, max rings in upper right quadrant); numbering proceeds clockwise, and fusion atoms are lettered. | |
| P-25.7 DOUBLE BONDS, INDICATED HYDROGEN, AND THE $\Delta$-CONVENTION | Fused systems must maximize noncumulative double bonds; excess hydrogen is indicated by H; cumulative double bonds use the $\delta$-convention. | |
| P-26 Phane Nomenclature | Used for complex multi-ring systems linked by chains, often preferred over ring assembly nomenclature when six or more rings/nodes are involved. | |
| P-28 Ring Assemblies | Used for systems where two or more rings are joined by single bonds (e.g., biphenyl); phane nomenclature (P-26) is preferred when seven or more rings are present. | |
| **P-3 CHARACTERISTIC (FUNCTIONAL) AND SUBSTITUENT GROUPS** | | |
| P-31.2 Hydro/Dehydro Prefixes | Indicate changes in hydrogenation degree; they are detachable for numbering priority but are **not** alphabetized with substituent prefixes, cited immediately before the parent name. | |
| P-33 Suffixes | The principal characteristic group must be expressed by an exclusive functional suffix (e.g., -oic acid, -ol); suffixes for radicals (‘yl’) and ions (‘ium’, ‘ide’) are also defined. | |
| **P-4 RULES FOR NAME CONSTRUCTION** | | |
| P-41 Seniority Order for Classes | A strict hierarchical list dictates which characteristic group must be cited as the suffix (the principal group); all other groups are prefixes. | |
| P-44 Seniority order for parent structures | Used to select the senior parent structure (ring or chain) when P-41/42/43 fail; generally prioritizes maximizing principal groups or choosing the senior ring system (P-44.2). | |
| P-44.3 SENIORITY OF ACYCLIC CHAINS (THE PRINCIPAL CHAIN) | Priority order: maximum number of heteroatoms > greater number of skeletal atoms (longest chain) > maximum number of multiple bonds (unsaturation). | |
| P-45 Selection of the Preferred IUPAC Name | Applied when multiple names derive from the same senior parent structure; maximizes multiplicative nomenclature (P-45.1.1) or the number of substituent prefixes (P-45.2.1). | |
| P-45.5 Criteria Related to Alphanumerical Order of Names | If other criteria fail, select the name that is cited earlier in alphanumerical order. | |
| P-46 The Principal Chain in Substituent Groups | Used to determine the main chain within complex acyclic substituents; criteria prioritize heteroatoms, chain length, multiple bonds, and maximal substitution. | |
| **P-5 SELECTING PINs AND CONSTRUCTING NAMES** | | |
| P-51.1.1 Substitutive nomenclature is preferred to functional class nomenclature | Substitutive nomenclature is the PIN default, except for specific retained functional class names (P-51.2). | |
| P-51.1.3 Skeletal replacement (‘a’) nomenclature is preferred to substitutive nomenclature | This preference applies when heteroatoms are present in chains and the conditions for skeletal nomenclature are met. | |
| P-51.1.5 Multiplicative nomenclature is preferred to simple substitutive nomenclature | Preferred when symmetrical conditions (P-51.3.1) are met, allowing multiple identical parent structures to be treated together. | |
| P-51.3.1 Preferred IUPAC multiplicative names | Requires identical linking bonds, symmetrically substituted multiplicative groups, and identical locants for all substituents on the identical parent structures. | |
| P-52.2.8 Selection between a ring and a chain as parent hydride | For PINs, the ring is generally selected as the parent hydride over a chain when a choice is necessary. | |
| P-59 Name Construction | Outlines the general methodology for assembling the name, including selecting parent hydrides/groups, numbering using P-14.4, and assembling components using P-16 conventions. | |
| **P-7 RADICALS, IONS, AND RELATED SPECIES** | | |
| P-70.2 Seniority of Radicals and Ions | Radicals are senior to anions, which are senior to cations, in terms of structural ranking as compound classes. | |
| P-70.3.1 Suffixes, prefixes, and endings for radicals and ions in substitutive nomenclature | Defines terms like 'yl' (radical suffix), 'ide' (anion suffix), 'ylium' (cation suffix), and 'elide'/'elium' (electron gain/loss). | |
| P-72.8 The suffixes ‘ide’ and ‘uide’ and the $\lambda$-convention | The suffix ‘uide’ is preferred with a parent hydride named by the $\lambda$-convention, but ‘ide’ is preferred over 'uide' when the $\lambda$-convention is involved in both anionic centers. | |
| **P-8 ISOTOPICALLY MODIFIED COMPOUNDS** | | |
| P-82.2.1 Nomenclature of isotopically substituted compounds | Nuclide symbol(s) and locants are placed in parentheses before the part of the name substituted. | |
| P-82.5.2 Priority between isotopically substituted and unmodified atoms or groups | For equivalent numberings, low locants are given to modified atoms; precedence favors the nuclide of higher atomic number, then higher mass number. | |
| P-83.1 Specifically Labeled Compounds | Position and number of nuclides are defined; the isotopic descriptor is enclosed in square brackets (rather than parentheses) in the name. | |
| P-82.6.1 Omission of locants | In PINs, locants required due to isotopic modification must always be specified, even if unnecessary in the unmodified name. | |
| **P-9 SPECIFICATION OF CONFIGURATION AND CONFORMATION** | | |
| P-91 Stereoisomer Graphical Representation and Naming | Stereodescriptors (R, S, E, Z, etc.) are added to the name; the fundamental name and numbering must remain valid despite the inclusion of stereodescriptors. | |
| P-92 CIP Priority and Sequence Rules | Defines the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) system used to establish precedence for ligands (atoms/groups) attached to a stereogenic unit. | |
| P-92.2 Sequence Rule 1 | Ligands are prioritized by decreasing atomic number (1a); if tied, the nearer duplicate atom node (in the digraph) takes precedence (1b). | |
| P-92.3 Sequence Rule 2 | Higher atomic mass number precedes lower (e.g., $^{3}\text{H} > ^{2}\text{H}$); this rule is applied only after Sequence Rule 1 is exhausted. | |
| P-92.4 Sequence Rule 3 | Establishes precedence for double bonds: ‘seqcis’ (‘Z’) precedes ‘seqtrans’ (‘E’), and this order precedes nonstereogenic double bonds. | |
| P-92.5 Sequence Rule 4 | Chiral units precede pseudoasymmetric units (4a); like descriptor pairs (RR/SS) precede unlike (RS/SR) (4b); 'r' precedes 's' (4c); applied when rules 1-3 fail. | |
| P-92.6 Sequence Rule 5 | The final tiebreaker: 'R' precedes 'S', 'M' precedes 'P', and 'seqCis' precedes 'seqTrans' (and similarly for auxiliary descriptors). | |
| P-93.4.1.2 | Multiple stereodescriptors (‘R’ and/or ‘S’) are enclosed in parentheses, followed by a hyphen, and placed at the front of the name, cited according to the ascending order of their corresponding locants. | |
| P-93.5.1.4.1 Specification of cyclic double bonds | In 3- to 7-membered monocycles, cyclic double bonds are assumed 'cis' and the stereodescriptor ('Z' or 'cis') is omitted; from 8-membered rings onward, 'Z' and 'E' must be specified. | |
